### Cloud-hosted Runtime extension

See the **[Marlowe starter kit repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit)** for instructions on how to use the cloud-hosted Marlowe Runtime extension in **[demeter.run](https://demeter.run)** without installing any software. 

The starter kit includes three on-chain example contracts along with instructions for setting up your environment for running them.
