The term *Runtime internals* refers to all of the Runtime executables, their command line options, what they need in their environment, and their dependencies. 

The Chain sync protocol is an application-level protocol for efficient, domain-specific traversal of a blockchain. For more context and details, see the **[Chain sync protocol spec](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe-chain-sync/docs/chain-sync-spec-1.0.md)**. 

The Marlowe chain sync is an efficient chain indexer and synchronization engine for the Marlowe Runtime. For more context and details, see the **[Marlowe chain sync README](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe-chain-sync/README.md)**. 

Navigate through the six pages that follow to see reference details for using the executables that are part of the Runtime internals.
