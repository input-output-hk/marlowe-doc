title: Application for scale testing of Marlowe Runtime
---

To run multiple contracts for multiple wallets, set environment variables to the hosts and ports for the Marlowe Runtime instances (see [Help](#help)), and on the command line supply that along with the number of repetitions and the pairs of addresses and keys.

```bash
marlowe-scaling 2 \
  addr_test1qryrafsnj3wt3as5pgeng8ddh42gq0dk8gphkz3mx8utzn6h3execksjs6h7k77qflc3mydgdlk98snlj6ngqzltl8mqjuqmk9=alice.skey \
  addr_test1qzl43spe69knxgfl5eqxrr89lwkef3elskmapjvzmy6akmu68l4aw87t9a9304rgj2p67tlrzaszh32ej3nlwp5t8zsqdcz20w=bob.skey \
|& jq 'select(.Contract)'
```

The output will show which transactions are submitted for which contracts, punctuated by an success/failure (`Right`/`Left`) report after each contract closes.

  This command-line tool is a scaling test client for Marlowe Runtime: it runs
  multiple contracts in parallel against a Marlowe Runtime backend, with a
  specified number of contracts run in sequence for each party and each party
  running contracts in parallel.

                           period is randomly increased up to a factor of two.
                           Increasing this value will increase the probability
                           that Marlowe Runtime's node has seen the transactions

                           period is randomly increased up to a factor of two.
                           Increasing this value will increase the probability
                           that the submitting node has seen the transactions
                           that Marlowe Runtime has seen. (default: 3)
  --retry-seconds INTEGER  Wait specified seconds after after a failed
                           transaction before trying again. No retries occur if
                           a non-positive number of seconds is specified.
                           (default: 10)
  --retry-limit INTEGER    Maximum number of attempts for trying a failed
                           transaction again. Each subsequent retry waits twice
                           as long as the previous retry. No retries occur if a
                           non-positive number of retries is specified.
                           (default: 5)
  NATURAL                  The number of contracts to run sequentially for each
                           party.
  ADDRESS=KEYFILE          The addresses of the parties and the files with their
                           signing keys.
