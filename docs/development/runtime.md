Marlowe Runtime is the application backend for managing Marlowe contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It provides easy-to-use, higher-level APIs and complete backend services that enable developers to build and deploy enterprise and Web 3 DApp solutions using Marlowe, but without having to assemble the “plumbing” that manually orchestrates a backend workflow for a Marlowe-based application. 

## Marlowe Runtime's role

Marlowe has a refined view of the Cardano ledger model. The job of Runtime is to map between the Marlowe conceptual model and the Cardano ledger model in both directions. Runtime takes commands relevant to Marlowe ledger and maps them to Cardano ledger. This can also be done with the REST API. 

Primarily, you can do two types of things with Runtime: 

* Discovering and querying on-chain Marlowe contracts 
* Creating Marlowe transactions

More specifically, the tasks you can do with Runtime include the following: 

* Creating contracts
* Building transactions 
* Submitting transactions 
* Querying contract history
* Listing contracts
* Other tasks
