We encourage your input and involvement with the Marlowe project. 

The first place to go to learn about how to contribute to the project is our **[Contributing to Marlowe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.adoc)** page. 

## Marlowe improvement proposals

If you are proposing a change to the Marlowe domain-specific language (DSL) or to the Plutus validator for Marlowe, please review: 

- **[Marlowe Improvement Proposal (MIP)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/MIPs)** process 
- **[MIP discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/MIPs/discussions)** 

The Marlowe team intends MIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting design decisions that have gone into Marlowe. 

MIPs describe standards, processes, general guidelines and information to the Marlowe Community. It is a formal, technical communication process that exists off-chain. MIPs do not represent a commitment of any form towards existing projects. Rather, they are a collection of proposed solutions to common problems within the Marlowe ecosystem. MIPs develop around different statuses, driven by one or more authors. 

## Marlowe development tools
