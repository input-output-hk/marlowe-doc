Explorers are useful tools to visually represent transactions on a blockchain. Since Cardano can have many transactions which can be hard to filter, Marlowe also has an **[open source explorer](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-explorer)** used to view Marlowe contracts. 

Visit **[Marlowe Explorer](https://marlowescan.com/)** to see this explorer in action, or use the links below: 

import Explorer from '@site/src/components/Explorer';
