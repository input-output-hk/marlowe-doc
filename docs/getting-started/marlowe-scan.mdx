Explorers are useful tools to visually represent transactions on a blockchain. Because Marlowe contracts are encoded in binary format on the chain, it can be hard to see what is happening within a Marlowe contract by using a normal Cardano explorer, and also there are many transactions that are unrelated to Marlowe and it can be hard to filter them. For these reasons, Marlowe has a specialised open source explorer called **[MarloweScan](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-scan)** used to view Marlowe contracts. 

Visit **[MarloweScan](https://marlowescan.com/)** to see this explorer in action, or use the links below:
