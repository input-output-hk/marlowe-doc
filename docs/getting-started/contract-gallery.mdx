## Example contracts on Cardano mainnet

If you want some inspiration and would like to get an idea of the variety of Marlowe contracts we have already run on mainnet, please browse through the examples accessed through the linked images above. The contract gallery contains various Marlowe contract use cases that have already been successfully executed on mainnet. 

Each tile in the gallery above corresponds to a **[Jupyter (.ipynb) notebook file](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.)**. Jupyter notebook files can be viewed in a web browser and use a format that supports an interactive computational environment combining code, text, and images.
