title: Deploy Marlowe Runtime
---

In this tutorial, you will deploy Marlowe Runtime with Docker in a Nix environment. Nix will provide a turn-key way to run all the services shown in this [architecture diagram](../platform-and-architecture/architecture).

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to:

 * Have a single or multi-user installation of nix
 * Working installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Configure Binary Caches

import Configure from './_partials/_configure-binary-caches.mdx';

<Configure />

## Start a Nix Shell

Nix is the recommended method of starting an environment to run all the steps below.

```
nix develop github:input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit
```

## Connect to Marlowe Runtime

Run `docker ps -a` to see a list of the running containers.

Check the service is healthy by running `curl -sSI localhost:3780/healthcheck
`. If all the containers are running, this should return a 200 response.
